# BlenderPy-Scripts
The SCRIPTING tab in Blender can be found on the upper-right-hand side of the interface. Once the tab is opened, you can load a copy of Python scripts in directly through copy-paste. It is also possible to copy the code on the left-side of the scripting interface by selecting the INFO button, pressing SELECT ALL, Ctrl + C, then Ctrl + V on the main scripting panel found directly under the SCRIPTING tab. Before running the script, be sure to check that the command "import bpy" is inserted at the top of the script. 

Blender keeps track of all your actions in the program, so you should be able to automate any set of steps or make them repeatable and exportable by experimenting with the directions above.
